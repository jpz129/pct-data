# ðŸŒ² PCT Data 

## ðŸ¥¾ About

Welcome to my PCT data repository! This is where I store raw data and work related to the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and other outdoorsy related things that I use on my blog, [pct-data.com](pct-data.com). 

Feel free to use any of the materials in this repository for your own projects. However, please be respectful and reference the repository or the blog if you use or modify anything here. Note that the materials in this repository may be a work in progress and may be updated or modified over time.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me or submit a pull request. I'm always looking for new ideas and ways to improve the repository and the blog!
